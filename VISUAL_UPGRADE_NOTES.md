# Visual upgrade notes

Notes for `VISUAL_UPGRADE_PLAN.md`, one section per stage. Stages 1–6 were run in
parallel git worktrees by separate agents and merged by the orchestrator; each agent
replaces only its own placeholder below.

## Stage 0 — Infrastructure

Done October 2, 2026.

**Tour.** `tests/visual_tour.gd` replaces the seed (deleted). 28 views, about 46 s:
`downstream_10h`, `upstream_10h`, `across_river_10h`, `far_wall_10h`, `near_wall_10h`,
`camp_10h`, `shoreline_close_10h`, `gravel_close_10h`, `under_oak_10h`, `overview_10h`,
`valley_low_10h`, `fish_underwater_10h`, `downstream_06h`, `downstream_13h`,
`downstream_1925`, `downstream_00h`, `rain_downstream_10h`, `across_river_d100`,
`under_oak_d100`, `wildlife_deer`, `wildlife_deer_close`, `wildlife_bear`, `wildlife_jay`,
`wildlife_quail`, `wildlife_squirrel`, `crew_work_10h`, `crew_supper_1936`, `store`.
Arguments `label=`, `only=`, `settle=`; it writes `views.json` and hides the HUD. Rig yaw 0
faces the river; the audit's names (and its `e2_across_lowwater`) were swapped.
Noise floor: full run against full run differs by at most 0.011/255 mean per view; an
`only=` run against a full run by at most 0.063/255. Each view gets a fixed frame slot,
an SDFGI restart and a snapped camera rig.

**Rain finding (harness, not game).** `rain.gd` ramps rain in over ~24 s and the sky only
takes overcast when `daylight.gd` `apply()` runs, which the audit called before the ramp.
The harness now sets overcast 0.8 and then calls `apply()`. At full overcast the sky still
turns darker and bluer rather than grey, and the 8 mm, 30 %-alpha drops are nearly
invisible — Stage 1 work.

**Known tour quirk.** The store's lighting depends on which claim views ran earlier in the
same process (cleared only by disabling SDFGI; cause not found), so the store is captured
first. In play the store follows the claim, so the tour's store may differ from play.

**Tools.** `tools/art/tour_sheet.py` (contact and before/after sheets, `tour.json`, gates;
luminance is Rec.709 luma on sRGB values and saturation is HSV — these reproduce the audit's
0.660/0.126 and 0.672/0.127), `tools/art/fetch_cc0.py` (Poly Haven and ambientCG into the
shared git-ignored cache, manifest rows in `assets/CC0_MANIFEST.json`),
`tools/art/manifest.py` (union/3-way merge driver, opt-in via the `git config` line in its
docstring), `blender/normalize_asset.py` (weld, decimate, Cycles normal bake, ORM repack,
tint, `<name>_distant.glb` LOD), `tools/art/audit_assets.py` with `tools/art/budgets.json`
(53 files: 35 pass, 18 legacy allow-listed with reasons, 0 failing; characters provisionally
use the animal budget and props the driftwood/stump/log budget), `tools/run_suite.sh`
(moved from the ignored `artifacts/v2/`, location-independent, `LABEL=` logs to
`artifacts/suite/<label>/`), `tools/art/gates/stage1.json`. `blender/common.py` now shares
its export settings as `GLTF_EXPORT`; `tools/art/seed/proof_in_scene.gd` takes arguments.

**Pilot.** Poly Haven `boulder_01` 1k: 66,122 → 3,000 triangles (500 distant), 2.06 × 1.60 ×
2.94 m, three 1k JPEG maps, 1.4 MB; tint 0.62/0.61/0.58 at 0.85 took mean albedo from 0.126
to 0.300 linear; audit passes; rendered in the live claim
(`artifacts/visual-upgrade/proof/`). Not committed — Stage 3 does the real intake.

**Suite.** 37/37 pass in 144 s. Added `miner_art`, `fishing_assets`, `fishing_launch`, and
`phase2_launch` (salmon, raid, deer, bear, day 132). Excluded: helper classes
(`composition_guard`, `subject_coverage`), `simulate_season` (exits 2 on three pre-existing
design findings), renderer/real-time capture and performance scripts, and
`reflection_cleanup_probe` (reproduces an engine bug).

**Frame budget** (`miner_performance`, p95, 5.5 ms target): downstream 3.44/3.46 ms (~2.0 ms
headroom), wade 3.75/3.78 ms (~1.7 ms), overview 4.18/4.43 ms (1.1–1.3 ms).
`crew_performance` 4.09–4.33 ms. The overview is the tight view.

**Baseline gate values.** `downstream_10h` lower-half luminance 0.665, saturation 0.123;
`downstream_13h` 0.681 and 0.118; `downstream_1925` mean luminance 0.452;
`downstream_00h` 0.108.

**Sourcing research** (git-ignored, `artifacts/visual-upgrade/`): every Poly Haven rock
scan is tan, ochre or rust, so rock meshes need re-skinning toward slate and granite; Poly
Haven has no oak, willow, alder, manzanita, toyon or deerbrush models. Animals: deer is
covered (Quaternius deer and stag via Poly Pizza; Kelgar doe and buck on OpenGameArt);
black bear, jay and California quail have no acceptable CC0 base; the only squirrel base
is an "undead" model that needs a repaint.
